# Good bit done

 - For some reason the function to check if a number is prime thinks 4 is a prime. Works fine otherwise
 - Need to find a good way to stop it printing commas after finding the last prime between 2 and the input number, probably easy but brain not working rn.
 - Still need to do the last function.
 - Need to add prompt/loop to ask user if they want to do it again
 - Btw I think I remember your serial number, but I also kinda guessed so check that to make sure its right
