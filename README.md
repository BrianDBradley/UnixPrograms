# Yo,
There were some hidden characters from opening it in text editor so I had to use a command to remove them and that command makes a new copy and a new name. Basically, the most current file is HW2-newnew. It's nearly done and I'm planning on finishing it here after a break but again letting you know in case you come back before I finish it. 
## Leftovers:
 - 10, 11, and 12 (evens, odds, and factorial) needed to be redone to fit negative numbers. I got a start on 10 and 11 and they do work for negative numbers now but not postive numbers for some reason. 
 - Also need to make 13 (prime) not a function. Assignment says no functions - guess he doesn't like people going the extra mile :confused:

 Everything other than that should be done
