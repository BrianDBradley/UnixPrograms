# This looks great! 
Thank you for finishing it up! I totally didnt notice we neded that desrciption at the top of the script, thank you for catching that.
I'll give this a solid lookover and if I find anything to update I'll let you know!

# wait i forgot
also the distinct sequence only accepts positive integers. Like the equation itself doesn't work unless n is positive. I put in a "hey n isn't positive message" for when n <=0 but the assignment doesn't say what should be output if its less than or equal to 0 so I guess we're just winging it. Let me know if that message works for you

I think that'll be totally fine. I take his projects very literally, down to the randomly capitalized letters, so this feels above and beyond!
