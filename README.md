# Hey Karyn,
I thought the assignment was taking command line arguments for the inputs - i.e. script.sh 1 2 3 where 1 2 3 are the arguments.
Turns out we need to prompt user for the arguments and read them in from there.
So keep that in mind if you start working on this. 
Shouldn't be that hard to change the code to fit this, but wanted to let you know in case you started working on it before I fixed it.
Deuces :v:
