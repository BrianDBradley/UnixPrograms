 - Some of the print statements are going in the wrong order. If i do a command like 'ls' through the system command, it prints before my print statement
   e.g. *output of ls*
        'Content of the file : '
   rather than the other way around
 - problem 12 asks for the local host, but all I can find in his slides are host, not local host. His example says it will print 'host OR local host' with no
   explanation as to why or how it will print one or the other :roll_eyes:
 - most of everything we need seems to be in his lecture 5 slides
