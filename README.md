# Serial number added!!!
11. doesnt make sense, it's not gonna display anything. I think its a fuck up on his part, or maybe its intentional. none of the file lines end in "programing" 
     - yeah he just fucked this one up I'm pretty sure. We've followed instructions exactly as told so I'm not worried about it
14. I cant get this one, but I wanna go running, so I'll come back to it
     - fixed, had to add -E after grep
     - Thank you!

### Don't forget to add your serial number up at the top
Pretty sure that's everything. I'll probably go back and check it one more time just to make sure but I think we're good.

Execute the file
• chmod +x HW2.sh
• ./HW2.sh
