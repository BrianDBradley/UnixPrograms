# Got done to 15
 - Some of the print statements are going in the wrong order. If i do a command like 'ls' through the system command, it prints before my print statement
- I adjusted for this usig a fflush on the buffer, need to see if hes actually used that in his notes though or he ma y throw a fit.
  
 - problem 12 asks for the local host, but all I can find in his slides are host, not local host. His example says it will print 'host OR local host' with no
   explanation as to why or how it will print one or the other :roll_eyes:
 - I also cannot find any difference
   
 - most of everything we need seems to be in his lecture 5 slides
