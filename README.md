# Yo,
Everything should be finished. I didn't realize I forgot to change my name to yours in the comment at the very top of your copy so be sure to change that. Everything else should have your name on it but doesn't hurt to double check. Also try a couple test runs and compare the outputs to his. Everything looks good to me but I may have overlooked something or there may be some case where it breaks.

 # wait i forgot
 also the distinct sequence only accepts positive integers. Like the equation itself doesn't work unless n is positive. I put in a "hey n isn't positive message" for when n <=0 but the assignment doesn't say what should be output if its less than or equal to 0 so I guess we're just winging it. Let me know if that message works for you
