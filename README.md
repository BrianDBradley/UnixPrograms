# HEEEELLLLLP 11 and 14
11. doesnt make sense, it's not gonna display anything. I think its a fuck up on his part, or maybe its intentional. none of the file lines end in "programing"
14. I cant get this one, but I wanna go running, so I'll come back to it

## Added some screenshots of slides to the repo
Some png files of screenshots of the slides for easy access. That way we don't have to go find them each time
