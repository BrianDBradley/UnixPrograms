# Half-ish done
At the bottom I put comments on where you can find the info to do the stuff. I stopped at problem 8 so I don't leave you with the more complex ones, but I honestly didn't look at what the next problems were, so if I stopped right before they become not so ridiculously easy that was completely unintentional. Went ahead and added both our names to the comments. Gonna leave it as named HW3 until it's time to turn it in then I'll rename it to what he wants.
